# Programming in Python 3
## A Complete Introduction to the Python Language
### by Mark Summerfield

Repository contains several exercises for Python3 inspired by book [Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321680561/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=hradecek-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0321680561&linkId=d3ce35494656455c10b76a051c3e067c) by Mark Summerfield.

Every exercise has a particular solution found in the [solutions](https://github.com/hradecek/python3-complete-intro/tree/solutions) branch, as well.

*Note*: Solutions has been coded by myself as I have walked through the book and serves only as
inspiration/comparation, as there is no single right solution.
You are strongly advised to strain your brain!
